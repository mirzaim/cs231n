# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Spring 2021
I've been following Stanford course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) in my internship program at [Rayanesh company](http://rayaneshco.ir/). Here I gathered my notes and solutions to assignments. The course lectures were recorded in [Spring 2017](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/), but the assignments are from [Spring 2021](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2021/).

## CS231n Assignments Solutions
Some concepts in assignments like transformers or Self-Supervised learning are not taught in the 2017 lectures. Self-Supervised learning question is solved, but transformers question is skipped. The Style Transfer question was omitted in the 2021 assignments, so I returned to the 2017 homeworks to solve that.
