    "As you have seen, RNNs are incredibly powerful but often slow to train. Further, RNNs struggle to encode long-range dependencies (though LSTMs are one way of mitigating the issue). In 2017, Vaswani et al introduced the Transformer in their paper [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to a) introduce parallelism and b) allow models to learn long-range dependencies. The paper not only led to famous models like BERT and GPT in the natural language processing community, but also an explosion of interest across fields, including vision. While here we introduce the model in the context of image captioning, the idea of attention itself is much more general.\n",
